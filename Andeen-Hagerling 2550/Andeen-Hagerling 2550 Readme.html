<h4>3. Installation Instructions<br>




</h4>





LabVIEW:<br>





Instrument drivers should be installed as a subdirectory of the labview\instr.lib. For example, the HP34401A <br>





instrument driver, which is included with LabVIEW, is installed in the following directory: <br>





<br>





labview\instr.lib\Andeen-Hagerling 2550<br>





<br>





Within this directory you can find the menu files and VI libraries that make up an instrument driver. The <br>





menu files allow you to view the instrument driver VIs from the Functions palette. The VI libraries contain <br>





the instrument driver VIs.<br>
